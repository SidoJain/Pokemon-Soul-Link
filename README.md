## Overview

The Pokémon Soul Link Nuzlocke is a cooperative challenge: two trainers link their Pokémon caught in the same area, so that if one Pokémon faints, its partner on the other team is also considered “dead.” This site helps manage your runs, pairs, and victory/defeat stats—making Soul Link easier and more engaging for Pokémon fans.

## Features

- **Game Management:** Create and manage Soul Link games with paired runs and players.  
- **Profile System:** Register as a trainer, set your username, and team up with friends.  
- **Pokemon Pair Tracker:** Assign, nickname, and record “soul linked” Pokémon pairs by game and route.  
- **Death Analytics:** View statistics on pair deaths, individual Pokémon, routes, games, and player performance.  
- **Responsive UI:** Easy navigation for desktop and mobile.  
- **Authentication:** Secure login for trainers.  
- **Peer Collaboration:** Real-time updates for both players.  

## Rules (for reference)

- Only the first Pokémon caught per area by each player are linked.  
- If a Pokémon in a Soul Link pair faints, both are recorded as dead.  
- Linked pairs must be stored or released together.  
- If one player fails to catch, both Pokémon for that route are forfeited.
