## Overview

The Pok√©mon Soul Link Nuzlocke is a cooperative challenge: two trainers link their Pok√©mon caught in the same area, so that if one Pok√©mon faints, its partner on the other team is also considered ‚Äúdead.‚Äù This site helps manage your runs, pairs, and victory/defeat stats‚Äîmaking Soul Link easier and more engaging for Pok√©mon fans.

## Features

- **Game Management:** Create and manage Soul Link games with paired runs and players.  
- **Profile System:** Register as a trainer, set your username, and team up with friends.  
- **Pokemon Pair Tracker:** Assign, nickname, and record ‚Äúsoul linked‚Äù Pok√©mon pairs by game and route.  
- **Death Analytics:** View statistics on pair deaths, individual Pok√©mon, routes, games, and player performance.  
- **Responsive UI:** Easy navigation for desktop and mobile.  
- **Authentication:** Secure login for trainers.  
- **Peer Collaboration:** Real-time updates for both players.  

## Rules (for reference)

- Only the first Pok√©mon caught per area by each player are linked.  
- If a Pok√©mon in a Soul Link pair faints, both are recorded as dead.  
- Linked pairs must be stored or released together.  
- If one player fails to catch, both Pok√©mon for that route are forfeited.
